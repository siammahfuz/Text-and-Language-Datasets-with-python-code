📚 Explore Text and Language Datasets Using Python
This project demonstrates how to load, process, and analyze text and language datasets using Python. It focuses on foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like tokenization, frequency analysis, and basic preprocessing techniques using popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face Transformers.

🧠 Key Features
Load built-in and custom text datasets

Tokenize and normalize textual data

Analyze word frequency and patterns

Perform basic text cleaning and preprocessing

Ready-to-use code snippets for NLP beginners

🛠️ Libraries Used
NLTK

spaCy

Transformers by Hugging Face

Python Standard Libraries (collections, re)

Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install nltk spacy transformers
python -m nltk.downloader punkt gutenberg
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Sample Code
python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
from collections import Counter

nltk.download('gutenberg')
nltk.download('punkt')

text = gutenberg.raw('austen-emma.txt')
words = nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower())
word_freq = Counter(words)

print(word_freq.most_common(10))
📊 Use Cases
Building vocabulary lists

Analyzing author styles

Preparing data for machine learning

Text classification preprocessing

📌 Future Improvements
Add POS tagging and named entity recognition

Visualize frequency data using matplotlib or seaborn

Integrate with Hugging Face datasets and models
